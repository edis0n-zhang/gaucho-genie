COURSE WAITLIST
The Waitlist button will become available on the Course Search Screen once the following criteria are met:
The student has enrolled in 12 units.
The department or instructor has enabled the waitlist for the course.
All lectures and sections of the course are full or closed.
For example, if there are 3 lectures and associated discussion sections of a course being offered.  The waitlist will only become active once all 3 lectures have no spaces which may be added.
When signing up for a waitlist, students will be prompted to select which of the sections would be acceptable as well as the grading option, repeat values, and units if appropriate for the course.
The signup screen will also display the number of students currently on the waitlist as well as any notes from the department so that the student may make an educated decision as to whether they would like to join the waitlist.
The units of waitlisted coursework WILL count toward the student's unit maximum for the current registration pass, unless the student has opted to link the waitlist to one of their enrolled courses.
Spaces that become available after some students have signed up for the waitlist may not be directly added.  They are reserved for students on the waitlist.  A student wishing to add to the course must sign up for the waitlist.
The watilist has an Auto Add feature that may be enabled by the department or instructor.  If enabled, spaces which become available will be assigned to the student at the top of the waitlist.  The student will be added and notified via email.
The waitlist may be set up to prioritize students on a first come, first served basis, or using other criteria (e.g. major, class level, etc.) to determine priority.
This feature will only add students that are eligible to add the course.  If a student is missing pre-requisites or does not meet major, level or other limitations, they must consult with the instructor or department offering the course.
